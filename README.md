# LCD Control Module using ESP32 (16x2 Character LCD)

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project implements a custom LCD driver for controlling a 16x2 character LCD using the ESP32 and the ESP-IDF framework. The LCD is controlled in 4-bit mode using only GPIO and timersâ€”*no external libraries* like hd44780 are used. This driver supports text display and scrolling animations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Interface a 16x2 LCD with ESP32 using GPIO
- Write your own driver logic without using prebuilt LCD libraries
- Display and scroll custom text
- Build a reusable component module (lcd/) for integration in other projects
